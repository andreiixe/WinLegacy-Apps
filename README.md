 <br>It is a collection of electron applications updated for Windows 10 but adapted to run on Windows 7.

# ðŸŒ± What software will exist?

All programs (those that function and can provide some of their functionalities) that are based on Electron, compiled on a patched version of Electron to run on Windows 7.

# Patched programs

- ArmCord
- VSCodium
- Github Desktop 
- GoofCord

# How long will it take for new programs and updates to appear?

As mentioned above, I need to provide certain functionalities for an Electron-based program to work correctly, and updates will be manual. However, how quickly these updates appear depends on whether the changes are not major

# How to run/install it?

Extract the ZIP file wherever you want and run the EXE.

# Source code ?
Unfortunately, at the moment I do not wish to provide the source code. Perhaps in the future, I might consider making it available.
